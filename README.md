AI-powered Resume Screening and Ranking System

🌟 Project Overview

In today's competitive job market, recruiters receive hundreds of resumes for a single job opening. Manually screening resumes is time-consuming, inefficient, and prone to bias. This project introduces an AI-powered Resume Screening and Ranking System, leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) to automate the evaluation process and rank candidates accurately.

This system ensures faster, unbiased, and more effective hiring by analyzing resumes based on job description relevance and presenting recruiters with the best-matched candidates.

💡 Key Features

✨ AI-Driven Resume Screening – Extracts and processes text from PDF resumes for intelligent ranking.✨ Advanced NLP Processing – Uses spaCy for text cleaning, tokenization, and lemmatization.✨ TF-IDF & Cosine Similarity – Computes resume-job description relevance with proven ML techniques.✨ Bias-Free Shortlisting – Focuses on skills and experience, reducing human bias.✨ Scalability & Efficiency – Processes multiple resumes simultaneously, reducing recruiter workload.

🔎 How It Works?

Step 1: Upload Resumes

Recruiters upload multiple PDF resumes into the system. The AI extracts text and prepares it for analysis.

Step 2: Job Description Processing

A job description is provided as input. The system cleans and converts it into a structured format for comparison.

Step 3: Resume Analysis & Preprocessing

Using spaCy NLP, the text undergoes lemmatization, stopword removal, and normalization, ensuring accurate keyword extraction.

Step 4: AI-Powered Ranking

TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) transforms text into numerical values.

Cosine Similarity calculates the similarity between the job description and each resume.

Resumes are ranked based on relevance to the job.

Step 5: Display Results

A structured ranking table is generated, showing the best-matched candidates for the role.

🎯 Why This Project?

🔹 Eliminates manual effort – Reduces the burden on recruiters by automating screening.🔹 Ensures fairness – Prevents bias in candidate shortlisting.🔹 Enhances efficiency – Processes large volumes of resumes within seconds.🔹 Improves hiring quality – Matches candidates based on skills, not just keywords.

📈 Future Enhancements

🚀 Integration of Deep Learning Models – Enhance ranking accuracy with transformer-based models like BERT.🚀 Optical Character Recognition (OCR) – Extract text from scanned/image-based resumes.🚀 Multilingual Support – Expand functionality to process resumes in multiple languages.🚀 Bias Detection & Fairness Module – Implement AI ethics guidelines to ensure non-discriminatory hiring.
